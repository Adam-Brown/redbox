In order to run these tests you'll need to get a classpath for Jython to use:

To get the class path: 
  In the base redbox directory run: mvn dependency:build-classpath -Dmdep.cpFile=classpath
  
Copy the classpath back to this test directory and jython <script> should now work.

You may also need the mock library (try to run the tests first though):
 1. Install setuptools: http://www.jython.org/jythonbook/en/1.0/appendixA.html#setuptools
 2. Install mock: http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/mock/#installing
    - Make sure you use the Jython easy install (might be something like sudo /opt/local/share/java/jython/bin/easy_install -U mock)
    
    
Test by running jython in the shell and importing mock


TO RUN THE TESTS:
  > jython AlertsTestData.py
  
TO TEST YOUR OWN Alert CONFIG
  > jython alert_test.py <config file>
  
  
These tests stub the interaction with ReDBox (HarvesterClient) so won't actually upload the metadata into the system.
